            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              This was my first ever freelance project and the client was very
              pleased with the outcome. Communication with the client was from
              utmost importance. This was done trough surveys face to face
              interviews, online meetings and over the phone. The wire framing
              and design was done in Figma. I used HTML plus Sass for the frame
              work to build components and JavaScript to enhance user
              experience. After that I created a custom Wordpress theme with
              taxonomy and the possibility to update relevant information by the
              client. I am still improving the site to make it more accessible
              for people with disabilities. Also the improvement of SEO to
              attract more organic traffic through strategic placement of
              keywords is an import aspect in the ongoing development.
            </p>
            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>
              The idea was to create a modern webpage not only in the looking
              but also in functionality.

            <h2>Technical specificatios</h2>
            <p>
              Here I approached the client with questions as to what extend the
              page would change from time to time. I did this with surveys and
              interviewing my client as this was a very important aspect in the
              development process. The feedback was valuable and considered in
              the design, as well as in the development process. The planing was
              done accordingly and a custom Wordpress© theme was created, first
              with HTML5, Sass and JavaScript which was then translated into PHP
              the native language of Wordpress©. You can check it out

            <h2>Wire frames & Navigation</h2>
            <p>
              The functionality of the web page was quite simple really. From
              the landing page all the links where clear and bold and would help
              navigate throughouts the entire site. Images acted as an
              introduction for the content and guide the user through the
              website.
